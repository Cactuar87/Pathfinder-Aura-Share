Add a buff to a PF1E actor. Name it whatever you'd like.

Give the aura actor a dictionary flag of "radius" with a value greater than 0.
optional: Give the aura actor a dictionary flag of alliesOnly with a value of "true" to allow sharing of disabled auras.

It will auto copy to other tokens except with:
Name becomes: Aura Name (Source Actors Name)
"radius" is set to 0 on the recipient


Adds the buff to allies if:
-The source actor has a buff with a radius > 0 and the buff is enabled, or:
-The source actor's buff has the "alliesOnly" dictionary flag set to "true", it shares the buff even if it's disabled.
  (This allows for buffs to be araus that don't aid the source)
  (alliesOnly = "true" + buff disabled)
 
Removes the buff if:
-The source dies.
-The source moves out of range.
-The recipient moves out of range.



Notes:
It occasionally throws an error (in the f12 console only) about trying to access a non existent document on an actor. 
This shouldn't hurt anything, but may be alarming if you hit f12 and notice it pop up every now and then.
