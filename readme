Add a buff to a PF1E actor. Name it whatever you'd like.

Give it a dictionary flag of "radius" with a value greater than 0.

It will auto copy to other tokens except with:
Name becomes: Aura Name (Source Actors Name)
"radius" is set to 0 on the recipient


If:
-The source dies, it removes the buff.
-The source moves out of range, it removes the buff.
-The recipient moves out of range, it removes the buff.
