Add a buff to a PF1E actor. Name it whatever you'd like.

Give it a dictionary flag of "radius" with a value greater than 0.

It will auto copy to other tokens except with:
Name becomes: Aura Name (Source Actors Name)
"radius" is set to 0 on the recipient


If:
-The source dies, it removes the buff.
-The source moves out of range, it removes the buff.
-The recipient moves out of range, it removes the buff.




Notes:
It occasionally throws an error (in the f12 console only) about trying to access a non existent document on an actor. 
This shouldn't hurt anything, but may be alarming if you hit f12 and notice it pop up every now and then.
