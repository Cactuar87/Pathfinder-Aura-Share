NOW WORKING - MINUS DELETING TOKENS. IF YOU DELETE A TOKEN YOU WILL HAVE TO MANUALLY REMOVE AURAS.

Manifest URL: https://github.com/Cactuar87/Pathfinder-Aura-Share/raw/main/module.json

Add a buff to a PF1E actor. Name it whatever you'd like.

Give the aura actor a dictionary flag of "radius" with a value greater than 0.
optional: Give the aura a dictionary flag of alliesOnly with a value of "true" to allow sharing of disabled auras.

It will auto copy to other tokens except with:
Name becomes: Aura Name (Source Actors Name)
"radius" is set to 0 on the recipient


Adds the buff to allies if:
-The source actor has a buff with a radius > 0 and the buff is enabled, or:
-The source actor's buff has the "alliesOnly" dictionary flag set to "true", it shares the buff even if it's disabled.
  Alternatively, you can name the flag "shareInactive" if that makes more sense to you. Either works.
  (This allows for buffs to be araus that don't aid the source)
  (alliesOnly = "true" + buff disabled)
 
Removes the buff if:
-The source dies.
-The source moves out of range.
-The recipient moves out of range.
-The source disabled the buff, and the buff does not have the "alliesOnly" flag set to "true"

Note: It does not apply the buff the moment a token is created. Rather, it does it on move/click/update. This will be addressed later.
