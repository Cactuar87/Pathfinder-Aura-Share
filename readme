----------------This if for: Pathfinder 1E-------------------------------
Pathfinder Aura Share: Automates the sharing of buffs between tokens. This makes handling auras easier. The conditions for automating the auras are listed in the notes below. (It's pretty simple)

--------Cliff Notes--------
_create the following:
-Item Type: Buff
-Dictionary Flag: "radius" & value > 0
....the buff  now auto shares
_optional:
-Boolean Flag: "shareInactive"    __share the buff even if it is toggled off. Great for buffs that don't buff an actor, but just their nearby allies.
-Boolean Flag: "shareEnemies"     __share the aura with enemies (instead of allies). Typically combined with shareInactive.

----------------------Better Notes----------------------
Add a buff to a PF1E actor. Name it whatever you'd like.

Give the buff/aura a Dictionary Flag of "radius" with a value greater than 0.

It will auto copy to other tokens except with:
The new buff name becomes: Aura Name (Source Actor's Name)
"radius" is set to 0 on the recipient 

optional: Give the aura a Boolean Flag of shareInactive to allow sharing of disabled auras. 
optional: Give the aura a Boolean Flag of shareEnemies to target enemies instead of allies. Combine this with shareInactive for enemies only. 



----------Conditions for Applying Auras-------------------
_Adds the buff to allies if:
-The source actor has a buff with a radius > 0.
-The buff is enabled, OR if the source actor's buff has the "shareInactive" Boolean flag.

_Adds the buff to allies when:
-They enter range (either actor can move).
-The buff is toggled on.
-A Token is created in the scene, and allies are in range.
-The aura actor's HP rises above 0.

Adds the buff to enemies if:
-The buff also has a "shareEnemies" Boolean Flag. Note: You typically would combine this with "shareInactive" so that the buff doesn't hurt the source actor.
 
Adds the Buff when:
-A new buff has a radius set to > 0 and the token moves or the buff is toggled. Best to create it on the actor then add to scene.
-The buff is toggled on.
-A token with an aura buff is added to the scene. (radius > 0)
-The actor's HP increases over 0, and the actor was previously dead.
-An actor moves into range of the buff.

Removes the buff when:
-The source moves out of range.
-The recipient moves out of range.
-The source disables the buff, and the buff does not have the "alliesOnly" flag set to "true"
-The source is deleted.
-The source's HP falls below zero, unless: It has the Diehard feat -OR- Unconscious Auras is toggled OFF in the menus.





---------------Updates------------
(v1.3.2)  Actors with an item, buff, etc named "Diehard" will now continue to share their auras when below 0 HP.
(v1.3.1)  Delete Token, Create Token are now working. Deleting a token removes inherited buffs. Tokens hitting negative HP now triggers immediately.
(v1.2.7)  Delete Token hooks have once again been disabled. They were causing a bug with stacking buff icons.
(v1.2.0)  Using the shareEnemies Boolean Flag on an aura will switch it to only impact enemies.* 
          *Combine this with ShareInactive or it will still impact the original token.
(v1.0.10) Code cleanup to improve readability and speed up processing of auras.




--------Potential Changes in Future Updates---------
-To Fix: Renaming an aura will not remove the old buff from a token. Rename auras on the character sheet before the token is placed on the scene.
